TODO:
- do up the arrival logic, passengers only board when its a direct bus (no layovers yet)
- make it so that routes are generated only at the start, not adapted, make sure all busstops are covered
- vary the number of passengers spawning at different stops so that there's strats in the bus dispatch
- instead of single stop maxqueue strat, do top 3
- count the rate of buses that visits each station n log it
